Welcome to the tutorial series for coding in python. You need these tools for coding in Python:

 - Python installed (latest)
 - Visual Studio Code
 - Python extension in VSCode
In VSCode, press Ctrl+Shift+P and search for "Open settings (UI)". Find autosave and make sure it's set to
autodelay.

Create a folder where you will do all the coding, then create a file called anything.py to get started.

Let's create a simple program to print something to the console. Press ctrl + `~ (tilde, above the tab key)
to open the terminal.

print("Something")

The line of code above will use the print() method and prints the string inside the parentheses. You will learn
about data types like string in the next chapter.
